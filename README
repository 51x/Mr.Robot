There are not much deeper interpreatations about Mr. Robot. Also I was surprised that a repository on GitHub called Mr.Robot didn't exist before I created it. I also don't plan to go much into this, but at least this repo exists now and something important is pointed out below.

For me Mr. Robot is a story about enlightenment and that even if someone is enlightened, physicically a body (which one have or not) can be fucked up. Why I think it's like that is the really good representation of how thinking inside goes, how deeper experiences are experienced, the mantra-like reperative dialouges of Elliot, the time confused scenes, the 'strange' dream scenes and so on. The FBI woman's discussions with some AI is also not to be missed.

The "Do you have the time?" question leads to something really interesting I think. If that's how the next season continues that will hit hard.


tl;dr "Even the enlightened ones walk on earth."
